Einstein's supposed refutation of absolute space and time is based on thought experiments that suffer from the [[GIGO fallacy]] 

All of Einstein's and Mach's (E-M) argument's against Newton hypothesize a universe that does not exist.

The present understanding of the Universe is either the BIG Bang most prevalent.  

 **Big Bang** - if the BB is correct then there is a point from which the universe started. This is then the origin point.  All distances can be measured measure from this point. Any nonsense that space is curved so we cannot use the origin point of the universe is not based in evidence 
  *Most cosmological evidence points to the universe’s density as being _[just right](https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html)_ — the equivalent of around six protons per 1.3 cubic yards — and that it expands in every direction without curving positively or negatively. In other words, the universe is flat.*https://www.astronomy.com/science/what-shape-is-the-universe/

This also assumes the thing that E-M proponents are trying to prove

**Steady State** - in a SS universe any large portion of the Universe the motion of the bodies would average to zero giving you an absolute frame of space.
