Mach was supposedly very influential on [[Einstein]]

  

This video does  a good job of explaining the fundamental metaphysical debate between Newton and modern physics, but ends up waving his hands to support the modern physics narrative   

[[Newton]] vs. Mach: The Bucket Experiment

After watching this I guessed that Mach was influenced by [[Kant ]]and guess what the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says  

He credited his philosophical awakening to reading, at age fifteen, his father’s copy of **Kant’s** _**Prolegomena** to any Future Metaphysics_:

> The book made at the time a powerful and ineffaceable impression upon me, the like of which I never afterwards experienced in any of my philosophical reading. Some two or three years later the superfluity of the role played by “the thing in itself” abruptly dawned upon me. On a bright summer day in the open air, the world with my ego suddenly appeared to me as _one_ coherent mass of sensations, only more strongly coherent in the ego. Although the actual working out of this thought did not occur until a later period, yet this moment was decisive for my whole view.

[[Feynman]] was clearly wrong when he said philosophy is irrelevant to physics.  These continental physicists tried to fit every new development with a Kantian (continental philosophy ) explanation.  The corruption of physics invetiably led to the corruption of all science,  Thus global warming, a food pyramid with fruit loops as being more nutritious than meat, Ivermectin  as horse paste, safe and effectiive

## What [[Einstein]] himself said about Mach?

> In his spiritual development, Mach was not a philosopher who chose the natural sciences as an object of speculation, but a multifaceted, keen naturalist who apparently took pleasure in investigating partial questions lying beyond the focus of general interest.
