A first step to explaining the Michelson and Morley experiment's null result was found in the [FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction "Length contraction"), now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by [George FitzGerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Francis_FitzGerald "George Francis FitzGerald") (1889) in a letter to same journal that published the Michelson-Morley paper, as "almost the only hypothesis that can reconcile" the apparent contradictions. It was independently also proposed by [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz") (1892).[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment#cite_note-lorentz95-32)



Light is a wave of the electric and magnetic fields.  Light is perfectly elastic in a vacuum.  Note a vacuum has a Vacuum permittivity,  permittivity of free space, the electric constant, and magnetic permeability

you always measure speed against something and position also. So you can't measure the speed or position of the MM apparatus with light in a vacuum. But what about an outside observer.  Because of the delays light will still appear to be moving at the speed of light.


Clock experiments analogy, what if we had assumed the clocks were right on boats at sea, there would have been incredible time warping.

The classical analysis predicted a relative phase shift between the longitudinal and transverse beams which in Michelson and Morley's apparatus should have been readily measurable. What is not often appreciated (since there was no means of measuring it), is that motion through the hypothetical aether should also have caused the two beams to diverge as they emerged from the interferometer by about 10−8 radians.[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment#cite_note-schum94-31)


This is not true if the light is traveling in a vacuum.

Does the Fizeau Experiment Really Test Special Relativity?

Clement, Gerard

American Journal of Physics, v48 n12 p1059-62 Dec 1980

The motivation and interpretation of the Fizeau experiment are reviewed, and its status as a test of special relativity is discussed. It is shown, with the aid of a simplified, purely mechanical model of the propagation of light in matter, that the experiment actually cannot discriminate between Galilean and relativistic kinematics.

Optical Fizeau Experiment with Moving Water is Explained without
Fresnel's Hypothesis and Contradicts Special Relativity

Fizeau experiment actually proves not partial, as the special relativity asserts, but complete dragging of the lightby moving medium. The decrease of the fringe shift in the Fizeau's two-beam interferometer is explained not with wrong Fresnel's aether drag hypothesis but with the phase deviations arising in the interfering beams because of
Doppler shift of the frequencies. Fizeau experiment does not prove but, on the contrary, refutes Einstein's theory of
relativity

In the same manner, length contraction, time dilation, the speed of light as a maximum speed, relative simultaneity, the relativistic composition of velocities, and all paradoxes dues to the special theory of relativity do not make any sense in physics. All these concepts are superfluous and erroneous. In this work, we re-analyze Fizeau's experiment by using the same approach we have pursued previously.
