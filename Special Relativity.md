SR violates conservation of energy (and matter ?)

Drop a ball in a high gravitational field g at a height at which it would reach .8c when it hits the ground.

PE = mgh
KE =1/2mv^2



So the mass when the ball hits the ground is 
# m=mo(1âˆ’v2)1/2

1.66666666... times larger

as a result the KE is 1,66666... times larger than the PE when we dropped the ball
