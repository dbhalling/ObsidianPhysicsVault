One of my favorite books on mathematics is “Euclid’s Window”.  Found it in Dad’s library and finally got around to reading it a couple of  year ago.

It’s a rare book that I’ve read more than once.  In any case, I think you mostly would have liked the author since here is a passage about Gauss’s opinion of Kant (seems you would have liked Gauss philosophically)

Particularly liked the part where he says that “Gauss did not dismiss Kant’s work out of hand.  He read it first, then dismissed it”

But even with Kant things are often not much better; In my opinion, his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions is one that either amounts to triviality or is false
